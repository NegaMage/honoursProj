    </h1>
    <h2>
    This metric is generated at each hospital. We go through their prescriptions, and find the drugs prescribed the least. This information can be used by suppliers to prioritise profits, and by manufacturers when considering effective production strategies.

    This is an output, generated from our stored tables at Hospital {{hospital}}. This metric is easy to summarise at each node. It's just going through each entry at the local requirements table, from the past week, and summarising data.

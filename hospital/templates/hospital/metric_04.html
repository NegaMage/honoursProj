        Metric 04s: Drugs least moved at Supplier {{supplier}}
    </h1>

    <h2>
    This metric looks at drugs least circulated by the supplier. An easy way to produce this metric is to look at all the drugs in stock at a supplier, and see which ones have been there the longest, and in largest amounts. 
    </h2>
    <br>

    <h2>
    This is an output, generated from our stored tables at Supplier {{supplier}}. This metric is easy to summarise at each node. It's just going through each entry at the local inventory table, from the past week, and summarising data.
